# Authentication Dialog Implementation

## Overview
Converted user authentication from separate pages to a unified dialog component, keeping only the admin login page.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: AuthDialog
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/auth/AuthDialog.tsx`

- Created a modal dialog component with tabs for Login and Sign Up
- Uses shadcn/ui Dialog and Tabs components
- Handles both login and signup flows in one component
- Automatically switches to login tab after successful signup
- Closes dialog and redirects to dashboard after successful login

**Features:**
- Tab-based interface (Login | Sign Up)
- Form validation
- Error handling
- Loading states
- Auto-redirect after successful authentication

### 2. Updated Header Component
**File:** `/frontend/src/components/shared/Header.tsx`

**Desktop Navigation:**
- Login button now opens AuthDialog instead of redirecting to `/auth/login`
- Changed from Link to button with `onClick={() => setIsAuthDialogOpen(true)}`

**Mobile Navigation:**
- Login button in mobile menu opens AuthDialog
- Profile icon button (when menu is open) opens AuthDialog

### 3. Admin Login Page
**File:** `/frontend/src/pages/auth/login.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Renamed from `UserLoginPage` to `AdminLoginPage`
- Updated title to "Admin Login"
- Updated description to "Login with your administrator account"
- Button text changed to "Login as Admin"
- Removed signup link
- Added check to prevent non-admin users from logging in via this page
- Shows error message: "Access denied. This login page is for administrators only."

### 4. Signup Page (Deprecated)
**File:** `/frontend/src/pages/auth/signup.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Converted to a redirect page
- Automatically redirects logged-in users to appropriate dashboard
- Redirects non-logged-in users to home page
- Shows loading spinner during redirect

### 5. AuthContext Updates
**File:** `/frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Updated `logout()` function to redirect based on user role:
  - Admins → `/auth/login`
  - Students → `/` (home page)

## User Flows

### Regular Users (Students)
1. Click login button in header (desktop or mobile)
2. AuthDialog opens
3. Can switch between Login and Sign Up tabs
4. After login → redirected to `/dashboard`
5. After logout → redirected to home page (`/`)

### Admin Users
1. Navigate directly to `/auth/login`
2. Login with admin credentials
3. After login → redirected to `/admin`
4. If non-admin tries to login here → shows error message
5. After logout → redirected to `/auth/login`

## Routes

### Active Routes
- `/auth/login` - Admin-only login page
- `/auth/signup` - Redirects to home (deprecated)

### Dialog-based Auth
- Login/Signup for regular users now handled via AuthDialog component
- No dedicated pages needed for regular user authentication

## Benefits

1. **Better UX:** Users don't leave the current page to log in
2. **Cleaner Navigation:** No need to navigate between login/signup pages
3. **Admin Security:** Clear separation between admin and user login
4. **Mobile Friendly:** Dialog works seamlessly on mobile devices
5. **Reduced Code:** Single component handles both login and signup
